['Adeshola Ore'],2023-07-28,Victoria announces ban on gas connections to new homes from January 2024,"Gas connections will be banned in new homes and government buildings built in Victoria from next year.

The announcement has been backed by environmental groups and the property and construction sectors but the opposition has warned the change could increase household energy bills fuelled by higher demand for electricity.

The Victorian government announced the major energy reform on Friday as part of its plan to reach net zero emissions in the state by 2045.

The government estimates the change will save households up to $1,000 on their annual energy bills – or $2,200 if they have solar installed – and reduce emissions.

From 1 January, new residential properties that require planning permits, as well as government buildings including schools and hospitals, will only be powered by electricity.

The state’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the changes would help a new homeowner to save on their energy bills.

“We know the cost of living for Victorians is getting bigger and bigger,” she told reporters on Friday. “Doing something about it is exactly what today is about.”

Environment Victoria said the changes showed gas had “no future” in the state.

“Gas is an expensive and polluting fossil fuel,” Environment Victoria’s chief executive, Jono La Nauze, said on Friday. “The long-term trend is that gas prices will keep rising whilst renewable electricity gets cheaper. It simply makes no sense to keep connecting new homes to the energy source of the past.”

The Greens backed the reform but said the benefits would be undermined by the government’s backing of coal and gas projects such as gas drilling near the Twelve Apostles. The change was supported by the Climate Council, the Clean Energy Council, Friends of the Earth Melbourne and the Energy Efficiency Council.

Property Council and Master Builders welcome change

It was also supported by the Property Council of Australia, whose national policy director, Frankie Muskovic, said the ban on gas connections provided certainty to the industry as it moves towards “zero-carbon-ready buildings”.

“Every new building built with gas will need to be retrofitted in the future, so we welcome this move from the Victorian government to avoid investment in new gas network infrastructure and focus on reducing energy bills, and providing cleaner, healthier homes for Victorians,” she said.

The Masters Builders Association Victoria’s chief executive Michaela Lihou said the ban would help create a pathway to a sustainable future for the state’s construction industry.

The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said the changes would reduce exposure to indoor air pollution and help tackle climate change. The RACGP’s co-deputy chair, Dr Aadhil Aziz, said the reform was a practical way to improve health.

“Gas stoves expose people to respiratory irritants, which leads to a multitude of respiratory conditions, and research indicates this includes triggering asthma in children,” he said.

The opposition on Friday argued the reform would drive up household energy bills because it coincided with a recent decision by Victoria’s Essential Service Commission (ESC) to increase the price of the default electricity offer by 25%.

Brad Rowswell, the opposition treasury spokesperson, said the changes were “desperate policy on the run”.

“We do need an orderly energy transition from our current circumstances to the ways of the future,” he said.

“I don’t think that this decision today will lead to lower energy prices.”

Innes Willox, the chief executive of business association Ai Group, said the decision was “a turning point”.

“A clear decision on the future of gas at least provides some certainty. But we mustn’t underestimate the impact on appliance supply chains, and we also need to ensure that gas users continue to enjoy secure supply,” Willox said.

The announcement comes after Victoria last year announced it would scrap mandatory gas connections on new homes, which will be phased out this year.

Victoria has the highest use of residential gas in Australia, with about 80% of homes connected. Gas remains the state’s dominant fuel source, particularly for heating homes during winter.

The gas sector contributes about 17% of the state’s emissions, and the move to electric systems is a key element of meeting Victoria’s nation leading emissions reduction targets of 75% to 80% by 2035 and net zero by 2045.

Last month, the ACT passed a ban on new gas connections as part of the territory’s target of reaching net zero by 2045. The New South Wales government on Friday said it had no immediate plans to match Victoria’s gas pledge.

The Victorian government will enact changes to planning provisions and schemes to ensure the changes can come into effect. It pledged to work with industry, including gas appliance manufacturers and trade unions, to support the transition.

D’Ambrosio said a new $10m residential electrification grants program would also be established. It will be available to volume home builders, developers and others to provide bulk rebates for solar panels, solar hot water and heat pumps to new homebuyers.

The Andrews government will release an updated gas substitution roadmap later this year that will outline further measures for electrification and energy efficiency to help Victoria reach net zero emissions.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85f99664fbf054e6c8a8bed909259c8345086f8e/31_69_3931_2358/master/3931.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8f81ed4cc6708a259e85ad493e43d81,[],"['homes', 'changes', 'victorias', 'energy', 'announces', 'future', 'states', 'victoria', 'gas', '2024', 'change', 'connections', 'help', 'ban']","Gas connections will be banned in new homes and government buildings built in Victoria from next year.

['Adam Morton'],2023-03-30,Australia passes most significant climate law in a decade amid concern over fossil fuel exports,"Australia’s parliament has passed the country’s most significant emissions reduction legislation in more than a decade after the government won backing from Greens and independent MPs for a plan to deal with pollution from major industrial sites.

After weeks of closed-door negotiation, a deal was brokered between the Labor government and Greens, a minor party with 15 parliamentarians, that included legislating an explicit requirement that total emissions from major industrial facilities must come down, not just be offset.

Australia is the world’s third biggest fossil fuel exporter. The Greens argued the deal would stop some new gas and coal development proposals, but acknowledged it would not prevent further industry expansion.

The deal to pass changes to the policy known as the safeguard mechanism is considered key to prime minister Anthony Albanese’s commitment to cut national carbon dioxide emissions 43% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.

From 1 July, many of the country’s 215 major polluting facilities – including fossil fuel operations, other mines, refineries and smelters – will need to cut emissions intensity by 5% a year, either through absolute cuts or by buying contentious carbon offsets. Together, they are responsible for about 30% of emissions in Australia.

While individual companies can buy an unlimited number of offsets, total absolute emissions under the scheme cannot increase and are required to come down over time. New gas fields opened for export project must offset all CO2 emissions, increasing costs for developers. Labor had rejected an initial offer from the Greens to support the bill if the government agreed to ban new coal and gas developments in line with scientific warnings.

The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, hailed the deal as a “landmark reform” that delivered on a promise to reverse nearly a decade of inaction on the climate crisis under the rightwing Coalition administration that held power from 2013 until last year.

He said it would lead to a 205m tonne reduction in emissions by 2030, which he described as equivalent to taking two-thirds of the nation’s cars off the road. “Today is an historic day for the country to ensure our economy can take advantage of the opportunities of decarbonisation and meet our ambitious climate targets,” Bowen said.

The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, described negotiating with the government as “like negotiating with the political wing” of coal and gas companies, but said fossil fuels had “taken a huge hit”.

“To everyone who is despairing about the future and wants real climate action, today you should have a spring in your step, because it shows we can take on the coal and gas corporations and win,” Bandt said. “The fight is not over, because in the middle of a climate crisis, Labor still wants to open more coal and gas.”

The legislation was opposed by the rightwing Liberal-National Coalition, despite it having introduced the safeguard mechanism in 2016. It initially promised the safeguard would stop industrial emissions increasing, but in practice often allowed companies to emit beyond onsite limits without penalty.

The Coalition’s climate change spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, said the changes to the scheme made it a “carbon tax by stealth” that would “decapitate” the economy. But the policy won broad support from major business and industry groups. Environment groups also supported the deal, but called on the government to stop allowing developments that expanded Australia’s fossil fuel exports.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ae1e8cf6f810ba3713658b0889cd1f5f7fdd44/0_105_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=631874c89867e6c4a324bf56e1733957,[],"['significant', 'law', 'fuel', 'concern', 'greens', 'safeguard', 'climate', 'australia', 'exports', 'gas', 'coal', 'major', 'passes', 'decade', 'stop', 'emissions', 'deal', 'fossil']","Australia is the world’s third biggest fossil fuel exporter.
